Toggled is a startup that has many developer-oriented projects. We strive to provide high-quality content with custom UI and UX. We have many products of use to developers, and more are coming soon.

### 📰 About Us

Hello, I'm Zak, I started Toggled so that together we could establish a community of developers that share the same passion. Toggled was founded on the belief of open source software, so most of our projects are available on GitHub. You can help us stay funded by purchasing a premium plan for one of our products or services.

### 🔨 Contributing to the developer ecosystem

We supply the tools that developers rely on to manage workflows and tasks. You can help us by purchasing our premium plans, contributing with pull requests or even just sending feedback.
